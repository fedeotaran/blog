My name is Federico Otaran and I'm Web Developer with almost 7 years of
experience. Since 4 years ago I have developed Web Applications with Ruby on
Rails framework as Full-Stack Developer. Now I live in La Plata, BA where I
studied Computer’s Science. I’m passionate about Computer’s Science and
although my biggest experience was as a developer I like to do team management
and devops tasks. About a year ago I'm really interested in functional
programming and distributed systems.
